# Microbial community visualization

MetaPepView provides several modules to visualize microbial communities from metaproteomics data:

- *Community composition*: Visualize taxonomy composition and compare taxonomy between multiple samples

- *Community function*: Visualize expression of [KEGG](https://www.kegg.jp/) terms and compare expression between multiple samples
