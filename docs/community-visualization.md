# Microbial community visualization

Meta-PepView provides modules to visualize microbial communities from metaproteomics data. Visualization of community composition and expressed protein functions from multiple samples are provided from the *Compositions and functions dataset*. The following community analysis modules are provided:

- *Community composition*: Visualize taxonomy composition and compare taxonomy between multiple samples

- *Community function*: Visualize expression of [KEGG](https://www.kegg.jp/) terms and compare expression between multiple samples
