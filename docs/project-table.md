# The project data

Samples that are imported into the dashboard will be stored into the *Project*. A single project consists of two datasets: The *Performance evaluation dataset*, and the *Compositions and functions dataset*. The former dataset allows storing of spectral and metaproteomics data of only one sample, while the latter allows sequential import of multiple samples into the dataset. Projects may be exported and imported in the dashboard, this is managed from the top row in the *Create project page*. Detailed instructions on how to import new data into a project is provided [[data-import|here]].

The project data is displayed on the bottom of the *Data Imports* page. Here, an overview is provided on the imported samples into the project. The *performance evaluation dataset* shows the name of the experiment, as well as what components are supplied into the dataset. The *Composition and functions dataset* provides a table of sample. This table gives a general overview of the imported samples: The sample names, names of taxonomy and functional database files, and information about DB Search and *de novo* data import. In addition, samples may be removed from the project via the project table.
